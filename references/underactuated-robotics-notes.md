# Underactuated Robotics Bite-sized Notes
based on course by Russ Tedrake http://underactuated.csail.mit.edu/
this bite-sized note is the register & cache to my cpu (my little brain)

## 1. Ultimate goal of underactuated methods
  - Develop new tools (based on optimization, ML, motion plan, control, etc) to design robots that are more dynamic and agile than state-of-the art
  
  - System theory that goes beyond robotics: provides powerful language for organizing computation in more complex system
  
  What I think: might be a huge investment in terms of systems engineering!!!
  systems engineering and integration of complex systems.....
