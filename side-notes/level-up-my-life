Hobbies i need to have

0. Main skillset to be one of the best engineers in the world
  - first principles
  - mechanical 
    -> modelling
    -> mechanical design
    -> prototyping 
    -> control system (underactuated)
    -> energy systems (thermo, heat transfer)
    -> manufacturing
  - firmware and software 
    Tools
    -> C/C++
    -> python
    -> maybe assembly?
    principles
    -> embedded system (MCU)
    -> FEA, CFD
    -> image processing (openCV)
    -> ML (deep learning techniques)
    -> graphics (OpenGL)?
    -> game dev?
    -> web dev?
  - Design
    -> graphic design?
    -> 

1. sharpen mind
  - develop games by following handmade hero
  - hardware side project
  - learn 1 new language

2. unleash creativity
  - YouTube Content creation (scicom/engineering/artsy projects)

  - Channel name: Hacky and Artsy
  - niche: hacks and arts, a little bit of both
  - accessible creative projects, with explanations of processes

-Tools
  - Davinci resolve?
  - after effects?
  - fusion 360?
  - blender
  - manim
  - Video/film
  - and first principles, of course.

Video Ideas:
  1. Woodworking --> Guitar stand
  2. hacky --> Spring measuring device (arduino)
  3. manim --> underactuated control / robotic manipulation
  4. I made a toy for my nephew
  5. i built a
 
3. fit and healthy
  - morning run
  - tae kwon do
  - planet fitness, workout


Listen to podcast
1. huberman lab podcast --> leverage biology to upgrade your life
2. world history
3. wtf is going on



1. Think about how to recycle trash, brain storm with chatGPT
2. make personal branding website
3. skills to learn:
  - Firmware --> stm32, ESP32, Nordic
  - advanced meche knowledge --> materials, thermo, fluid dynamics, etc
  - animation --> blender
  - vector graphics and editing --> adobe stuff
  - robotics --> underactuated, navigation, and robotic manipulation 
  - machine learning --> how to be good at training and deploying models
  - Craftsmanship --> wood working etc.
